```sql
USE sakila;
```
-- 1a. Display the first and last names of all actors from the table actor.
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name 
FROM actor
;
```
-- 1b. Display the first and last name of each actor in a single column in upper case letters. Name the column Actor Name.
```sql
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)
AS Actor_Name
FROM actor
;
```
-- 2a. You need to find the ID number, first name, and last name of an actor, of whom you know only the first name, "Joe." What is one query would you use to obtain this information?
```sql
SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name
FROM actor
WHERE first_name = 'JOE'
;
```
-- 2b. Find all actors whose last name contain the letters GEN:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM actor
WHERE last_name LIKE ('%GEN%')
;
```
-- 2c. Find all actors whose last names contain the letters LI. This time, order the rows by last name and first name, in that order:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM actor
WHERE last_name LIKE ('%LI%')
ORDER BY last_name, first_name
;
```
-- 2d. Using IN, display the country_id and country columns of the following countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and China:
```sql
SELECT country_id, country
FROM country
WHERE country IN ('Afghanistan', 'Bangladesh', 'China')
;
```
-- 3a. Add a middle_name column to the table actor. Position it between first_name and last_name. Hint: you will need to specify the data type.
```sql
ALTER TABLE actor
	ADD COLUMN middle_name VARCHAR(50)
;
```
-- 3b. You realize that some of these actors have tremendously long last names. Change the data type of the middle_name column to blobs.
```sql
ALTER TABLE actor
	MODIFY middle_name BLOB
;
```
-- 3c. Now delete the middle_name column.
```sql
ALTER TABLE actor
DROP COLUMN middle_name
;
```
-- 4a. List the last names of actors, as well as how many actors have that last name.
```sql
SELECT last_name, COUNT(last_name) AS Count
FROM actor
GROUP BY last_name
;
```

```sql
SELECT last_name, COUNT(last_name) AS Count
FROM actor
GROUP BY last_name
HAVING COUNT(last_name) > 1
;
```
-- 4c. Oh, no! The actor HARPO WILLIAMS was accidentally entered in the actor table as GROUCHO WILLIAMS, the name of Harpo's second cousin's husband's yoga teacher. Write a query to fix the record.
```sql
UPDATE actor
SET first_name = 'HARPO'
WHERE first_name = 'GROUCHO' and last_name = 'WILLIAMS'
;
```
-- 4d. Perhaps we were too hasty in changing GROUCHO to HARPO. It turns out that GROUCHO was the correct name after all! In a single query, if the first name of the actor is currently HARPO, change it to GROUCHO. Otherwise, change the first name to MUCHO GROUCHO, as that is exactly what the actor will be with the grievous error. BE CAREFUL NOT TO CHANGE THE FIRST NAME OF EVERY ACTOR TO MUCHO GROUCHO, HOWEVER! (Hint: update the record using a unique identifier.)
-- Get Harpo William's actor ID
```sql
SELECT actor_id
FROM actor
WHERE first_name = 'HARPO' AND last_name = 'WILLIAMS'
;
```
-- Update row where actor_id = Harpo Williams' actor_id
```sql
UPDATE actor
SET first_name = 'GROUCHO'
WHERE actor_id = 172
;
```
-- 5a. You cannot locate the schema of the address table. Which query would you use to re-create it?
```sql
SHOW CREATE TABLE actor
;

CREATE TABLE `actor` (
  `actor_id` smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `first_name` varchar(45) NOT NULL,
  `last_name` varchar(45) NOT NULL,
  `last_update` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  `middle_name` blob,
  PRIMARY KEY (`actor_id`),
  KEY `idx_actor_last_name` (`last_name`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=201 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8
;
```
-- 6a. Use JOIN to display the first and last names, as well as the address, of each staff member. Use the tables staff and address:
```sql

FROM staff
INNER JOIN address
ON staff.address_id = address.address_id
;
```
-- 6b. Use JOIN to display the total amount rung up by each staff member in August of 2005. Use tables staff and payment.

FROM staff
INNER JOIN payment
ON staff.staff_id = payment.staff_id
GROUP BY payment.staff_id
;
```
-- 6c. List each film and the number of actors who are listed for that film. Use tables film_actor and film. Use inner join.
```sql
SELECT  
	film.title, 
    COUNT(film_actor.actor_id) AS Actor_Count
FROM film
INNER JOIN film_actor
ON film.film_id = film_actor.film_id
GROUP BY film.title

		FROM film
		WHERE title = 'Hunchback Impossible'

;
```
-- 6e. Using the tables payment and customer and the JOIN command, list the total paid by each customer. List the customers alphabetically by last name:
```sql
SELECT 
	customer.first_name, 
    customer.last_name, 
    customer.customer_id, 
    SUM(payment.amount) AS Total_Paid
FROM 
	customer
INNER JOIN 
	payment
ON 
	customer.customer_id = payment.customer_id
GROUP BY 
	customer.customer_id
ORDER BY 
	customer.last_name
;
```
-- 7a. The music of Queen and Kris Kristofferson have seen an unlikely resurgence. As an unintended consequence, films starting with the letters K and Q have also soared in popularity. 
-- Use subqueries to display the titles of movies starting with the letters K and Q whose language is English.
```sql
SELECT title
FROM film
WHERE title LIKE ('K%') OR title LIKE ('Q%') AND title IN(
	SELECT title
	FROM film
	WHERE language_id IN(

		FROM language
		WHERE name = 'English'
		)
	)
;
```

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM actor
WHERE actor_id IN(

		FROM film
		WHERE title = 'Alone Trip'
		)
	)

INNER JOIN city
ON city.city_id = address.city_id
INNER JOIN country
ON city.country_id = country.country_id
WHERE country = 'Canada'

-- 7h. List the top five genres in gross revenue in descending order. (Hint: you may need to use the following tables: category, film_category, inventory, payment, and rental.)
